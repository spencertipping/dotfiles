# dotfiles
This repo exists solely to make it easy for me to install my dotfiles on new
machines/environments. Feel free to use stuff from it, but be forewarned that
it's undocumented and may change/break at any time.

What I'm saying is that if you're here looking for configs, you have done
something terribly wrong with your life; better things are out there :)
