# dotfiles
Released into the public domain for anyone unfortunate enough to share my
sensibilities. This repo exists mostly to make it easier for me to get new
machines working, but it might be a useful starting point for your own dotfiles
(these were started with
[Crunchbang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrunchBang_Linux) defaults).

The background in that screenshot is
[here](http://spencertipping.com/dotfiles-background2.jpg), generated using
[this
process](https://github.com/spencertipping/www/blob/master/note-wallpapers.md).

To install these as your dotfiles:

```sh
$ ./setup yes-really
```

My `.bashrc` sources [dotbash](https://github.com/spencertipping/dotbash), which
it will clone for you if you don't have it already.

The default setup provides several extensions:

- [cd](https://github.com/spencertipping/cd)
- [bashrc-tmux](https://github.com/spencertipping/bashrc-tmux)
- [bash-prompt](https://github.com/spencertipping/bash-prompt)
- [bash-lambda](https://github.com/spencertipping/bash-lambda)

You'll see these being installed from their git repos the first time you run a
new shell with this setup.

Conky config generated by
[conky-compiler](https://github.com/spencertipping/conky-compiler). You'll need
to use TypeCatcher to download Jura to make `conkyrc` work.


## Things you might not expect out of the box
- [Ridiculously fast key repeat rate](./xinitrc#L6)
- I've disabled right-click for the openbox menu; use `Win+Space` instead
- I'm using an XPS 13 with 4K screen, so fonts may be very large
- There are [no window borders](openbox/rc.xml#L15) (also
  [here](openbox/rc.xml#L233))
- I use `rxvt-unicode` rather than `gnome-terminal` or similar
- Window-resize is `Shift+Alt+Drag`, not `Alt+RightDrag`
- vim has `q` bound to `:x<enter>`, which will save+quit immediately
- Terminals are 86 columns wide, the extra to make space for vim line numbers


## Stuff referenced by these configs
...almost all of which are `apt-get install`able.

- `rxvt-unicode`: terminal emulator
- `openbox`: window manager
- `xcompmgr`: compositing for window transparency
- `tmux`: persistent SSH shell sessions
- `xpra`: persistent SSH X forwarding, and much faster than `ssh -X`
- `feh`: set the desktop background
- `audacious`: music player (the openbox config has some shortcuts for this)
- `xsel`: command-line access to X clipboard
- `chromium-browser`: because I can't be bothered to install proper chrome
- `transset`: set baseline transparency of a window, for compositing
- `shutter`: take screenshots
- `spacemacs` is an Emacs thing; `git clone` to install from [their
  website](http://spacemacs.org)
- `xtrlock`: screen locking

I use `vim-gtk` to get clipboard integration. `apt-get install vim` may or may
not be sufficient; I'm not sure.

If you want the 10x10 matrix of workspaces, you'll need to have
[`setlayout`](http://openbox.org/dist/tools/setlayout.c) in your `$PATH`
somewhere.


## Openbox keybindings
These are pretty much all custom, but I've been using them for a few years and
like the way they work. Almost every shortcut uses the `Win` key.

**TODO:** finish this section

### Desktops
- `W-[hjkl]`: change desktops, using vim key directions
- `W-S-[hjkl]`: change desktop and bring focused window along
- `W-[ionm,]`: go to specific desktops
- `W-d`: show desktop
- `W-q`: lock screen
- `W-Space`: show openbox menu

### Windows
- `Alt+F4`: close a window

- `Alt+Space`: show window menu

- `W-s`: sticky
- `W-f`: toggle horizontal maximize

### Running things
- `W-t`: run a terminal
- `W-w`: run firefox
- `W-S-w`: run `chromium-browser`
- `W-a`: run audacious
- `W-S-a`: use `transset` to make Audacious 90% transparent and focus it
